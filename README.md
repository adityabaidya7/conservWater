Web application for providing water conservation and efficiency related articles, and also a discussion forum for sharing information.
Problem Statement : Use of Digital Knowledge Sharing Platform like Wikis on sharing of water efficient techniques and methods for minimizing water scarcity.

Description : Background: The absence of a centralized knowledge-sharing platform like wikis significantly hampers the dissemination of water-efficient techniques, which could mitigate water scarcity. Despite the existence of various methods to conserve water, especially in agriculture, the lack of awareness and accessibility to this information perpetuates inefficient water use. This gap in knowledge sharing contributes to the overuse of water resources and exacerbates water stress, particularly in regions where agriculture is heavily dependent on irrigation. Establishing a comprehensive, accessible platform could catalyze the adoption of sustainable practices, crucial for addressing the global challenge of water scarcity. Detailed Description: A centralized knowledge-sharing platform akin to Wikis would facilitate the exchange of innovative methods, successful case studies, and research findings, fostering local and global collaboration. Without it, valuable insights remain siloed, hindering the adoption of practices that could conserve water resources and enhance sustainability. The creation of an accessible, comprehensive repository of water conservation strategies is thus critical for addressing the pressing challenge of water scarcity worldwide. Expected Solution: To address the lack of knowledge sharing platforms on water efficiency, creating a dedicated wiki-style database is the key. This platform would host peer-reviewed articles on water-saving techniques, community forums for sharing local knowledge, videos and interactive tools for calculating water usage and savings. Additionally, integrating social media sharing can amplify reach and engagement, while mobile app development ensures accessibility for users in remote areas, contributing significantly to the reduction of water scarcity globally.
